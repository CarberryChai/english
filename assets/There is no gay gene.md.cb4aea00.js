Those research \uFB01ndings have not been <mark>replicated</mark>. But it was never going to be that simple: decades of genetic research have shown that almost every human characteristic is a complex <mark>interplay</mark> of genes and environmental factors. A new study, published in Science this week, con\uFB01rms that this is the case for human sexuality, too. <br> The study, the largest ever into this dif\uFB01cult topic, was <mark>conducted</mark> by an international group of scientists working with 23andMe, a personal genomics \uFB01rm. It used what is called a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 408,995 individuals in the uk Biobank, a British health resource, and 68,527 American 23andMe users\u2014all of whom remained <mark>anonymous</mark> and <mark>consented</mark> to the study. <br> A GWAS involves scanning a person\u2019s dna for tiny <mark>variations</mark> in the genetic code (simple changes in the As, Ts, Gs or Cs) that <mark>correlate</mark> with a given <mark>trait</mark>. The <mark>participants</mark> were divided on the basis of whether they answered yes or no to the question \u201CHave you ever had sex with someone of the same sex?\u201D\u2014a <mark>woolly proxy</mark> for sexual orientation, even in the absence of little <mark>white lies</mark>. The \uFB01gures the GWAS produced, therefore, relate only to a single act, not to whether someone identi\uFB01es as gay. <br> The researchers found \uFB01ve genetic markers that were signi\uFB01cantly associated with a reported homosexual act by one of the participants in the study. None of those markers was on the x or y sex chromosomes and their total combined effect <mark>accounted for</mark> less than 1% of the variance. This is because the behaviour is the result of the <mark>aggregate</mark> effort of hundreds or thousands of genes, whose individual effects are in\uFB01nitesimally weak. <mark>Totting up</mark> all the thousands of tested genetic variants accounted for between 8% and 25% of the variation in people\u2019s self-reported homosexual acts. These variants also <mark>overlapped</mark> with other traits, such as a smoking and an openness to new experiences. <br> Interestingly, only about 60% of the genetic variants identi\uFB01ed in the study were shared by both sexes. Most behaviours show more overlap between the sexes than this, <mark>intimating</mark> that male and female homosexuality, or at least sexual adventures, may be quite different. David Curtis of University College London notes that what overlap there is \u201Csuggests that there could be speci\uFB01c factors affecting same-sex attraction rather than simply being attracted to males versus being attracted to females.\u201D</p><h2 id="the-riddles-go-on" tabindex="-1">The <mark>riddles</mark> go on <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-riddles-go-on" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Conscious of the tricky subject matter, the scientists are <mark>at pains to</mark> <mark>anticipate</mark> any misunderstandings or <mark>backlash</mark>.

But at least this study should <mark>add weight to</mark> the view that nonheterosexual behaviour is \uFB01rmly within the normal, natural <mark>spectrum</mark> of human diversity and provide a \uFB01rm foundation for future work.</p><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>in part <br><strong>in some degree</strong>: <strong>partially</strong> (\u4E00\u5B9A\u7A0B\u5EA6\u4E0A\uFF0C\u90E8\u5206) <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">\u21A9\uFE0E</a></p></li><li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>orientation <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/orientation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see merriam webster</a><br> a person&#39;s sexual identity or self-identification as bisexual, straight, gay, lesbian, pansexual, etc. : the state of being bisexual, straight, gay, lesbian, pansexual, etc. : sexual orientation <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">\u21A9\uFE0E</a></p></li><li id="fn3" class="footnote-item"><p>controversial <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/controversial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see merriam webster</a> <br> \u540D\u8BCD\uFF1Acontroversy a discussion marked especially by the expression of opposing views: dispute <br> // The decision aroused a controversy among the students. <a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-backref">\u21A9\uFE0E</a></p></li><li id="fn4" class="footnote-item"><p>notion <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/notion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see merriam webster</a> <br><strong>webster</strong>: an individual&#39;s conception or impression of something known, experienced, or imagined <br> // The had different notions of right and wrong. <br><strong>cambridge</strong>: a belief or idea <br> // The show&#39;s director rejects the notion that seeing violence on television has a harmful effect on children.<br> // I have only a vague(\u6A21\u7CCA\u7684) notion of what she does for a living. <a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-backref">\u21A9\uFE0E</a></p></li></ol></section>',7),n=[s];function i(h,l,d,m,c,f){return a(),t("div",null,n)}var p=e(o,[["render",i]]);export{g as __pageData,p as default};
