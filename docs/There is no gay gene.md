# There is no "gay gene"

## But biology does <mark>in part</mark>[^1] determine sexual <mark>orientation</mark>[^2] <br>
In 1993 a region of the human genome called xq28 was linked to male homosexuality, and the <mark>controversial</mark>[^3] <mark>notion</mark>[^4] of a “gay gene” was born. Those research ﬁndings have not been <mark>replicated</mark>. But it was never going to be that simple: decades of genetic research have shown that almost every human characteristic is a complex <mark>interplay</mark> of genes and environmental factors. A new study, published in Science this week, conﬁrms that this is the case for human sexuality, too. <br>
The study, the largest ever into this difﬁcult topic, was <mark>conducted</mark> by an international group of scientists working with 23andMe, a personal genomics ﬁrm. It used what is called a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 408,995 individuals in the uk Biobank, a British health resource, and 68,527 American 23andMe users—all of whom remained <mark>anonymous</mark> and <mark>consented</mark> to the study. <br>
A GWAS involves scanning a person’s dna for tiny <mark>variations</mark> in the genetic code (simple changes in the As, Ts, Gs or Cs) that <mark>correlate</mark> with a given <mark>trait</mark>. The <mark>participants</mark> were divided on the basis of whether they answered yes or no to the question “Have you ever had sex with someone of the same sex?”—a <mark>woolly proxy</mark> for sexual orientation, even in the absence of little <mark>white lies</mark>. The ﬁgures the GWAS produced, therefore, relate only to a single act, not to whether someone identiﬁes as gay. <br>
The researchers found ﬁve genetic markers that were signiﬁcantly associated with a reported homosexual act by one of the participants in the study. None of those markers was on the x or y sex chromosomes and their total combined effect <mark>accounted for</mark> less than 1% of the variance. This is because the behaviour is the result of the <mark>aggregate</mark> effort of hundreds or thousands of genes, whose individual effects are inﬁnitesimally weak. <mark>Totting up</mark> all the thousands of tested genetic variants accounted for between 8% and 25% of the variation in people’s self-reported homosexual acts. These variants also <mark>overlapped</mark> with other traits, such as a smoking and an openness to new experiences. <br>
Interestingly, only about 60% of the genetic variants identiﬁed in the study were shared by both sexes. Most behaviours show more overlap between the sexes than this, <mark>intimating</mark> that male and female homosexuality, or at least sexual adventures, may be quite different. David Curtis of University College London notes that what overlap there is “suggests that there could be speciﬁc factors affecting same-sex attraction rather than simply being attracted to males versus being attracted to females.”
## The <mark>riddles</mark> go on
Conscious of the tricky subject matter, the scientists are <mark>at pains to</mark> <mark>anticipate</mark> any misunderstandings or <mark>backlash</mark>. They <mark>collaborated</mark> with LGBT advocacy groups throughout the study. <br>
Yet the research only <mark>scrapes</mark> the surface of the mysterious depths of human sexuality. <mark>Unravelling</mark> these riddles will be diffult and will <mark>inevitably</mark> <mark>beget</mark> misconception and <mark>controversy</mark>. But at least this study should <mark>add weight to</mark> the view that nonheterosexual behaviour is ﬁrmly within the normal, natural <mark>spectrum</mark> of human diversity and provide a ﬁrm foundation for future work.
